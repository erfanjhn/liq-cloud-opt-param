This project allows the visualisation of the fits used the parameterizations included in the paper  submitted to JAMES journal  E.Jahangir et al. 
XXX files contain the coefficients of the fits explained in the section 3.3 of the paper. 
The reference Single Scattering Properties calculated with the Lorenz-Mie method for 4 shapes of Lognormal distribution function and with 9 spectral averaging methods on 80 effective radii ranging between 1 and 50 micro meters and tabulated in netCDF file called Ref_Log.nc.
Note that the band arrangement differes from that of the RRTM (which is used in ecRad code and sub)
