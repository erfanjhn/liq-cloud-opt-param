This project allows the visualisation of the fits used the parameterizations included in the paper  submitted to JAMES journal  E.Jahangir et al. 
XXX files contain the coefficients of the fits explained in the section 3.3 of the paper. 
The reference SSPs calculated with the Lorenz-Mie method and tabulated based on spectral band and droplet size are included in XXX files.  
Note that the band arrangement differes from that of the RRTM (which is used in ecRad code and sub)
